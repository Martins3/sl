It responds to bus transactions generated by others by updating its state, and sometimes intervenes in completing the transaction.
That is, once a request is placed on the bus, all phases of the transaction including the data response complete before any other request from any processor is allowed access to the bus.
The data may be in the writerâ€™s cache in a valid state, but since a transaction must be generated this is called a write miss just like a write to a block that is not present or invalid in the cache
The L3 cache allocates lines to an available subcache, accounting for any address-based restrictions and giving preference to any subcache containing, invalid entries in the indexed set.
